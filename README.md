#### Game 1:

[Number Guessing Game](number_guessing.py)

#### Overview:

The player will have a limited number of chances to guess a random number within a specified range.
Each guess will give them feedback (too high, too low) until they either guess correctly or run out of attempts.

#### Game Requirements:
* Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
* Allow the player to guess the number.
* Provide feedback on each guess: "too high," "too low," or "correct."
* Limit the player to a maximum of 5 attempts.
* If the player guesses correctly within 5 tries, they win; otherwise, they lose.
